Project App for Google CodeLab: Load and Display Images from the Internet
To practice the concepts you learned in this unit, including coroutines, Retrofit, and Gson, you're going to build an app on your own that displays a list of books with images from the Google Books API.

The app is expected to do the following:

 - Make a request to the Google Books API using Retrofit.
 - Parse the response using Gson.
 - Display asynchronously downloaded images of the books along with their titles in a vertical grid.
 - Implement best practices, separating the UI and data layer, by using a repository.
 - Write tests for code that requires the network service, using dependency injection.
 - The goal of this project is twofold. First, you get to put all the concepts you've learned in this unit into practice. You also get to work with a brand new REST API, read documentation, and apply the skills you've learned into a new app, just like you'd do as a professional Android developer.

The following screenshot shows an example of the finished Bookshelf app. The exact layout and books displayed by the app is up to you. You learn more about how to retrieve the book data in the following sections.
